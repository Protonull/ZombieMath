# Zombie Math

This was a game made during a GameJam in March 2016 and is the spiritual successor to [CarGame](https://github.com/Protonull/CarGame). It's wildly incomplete but that's because a large portion of the effort went into creating custom assets for the game. This uses [ImpactJS](https://github.com/phoboslab/impact) as the game engine.

## How to play

The game will begin automatically and zombies will begin to approach the house, slowly at first and then getting progressively faster. Equations (just single numbers at first) will appear below the grass layer. Answering them with the correct number on your keyboard will grant you a bullet, but pressing the wrong number will cost you a bullet. Once you get five bullets, it will upgrade into a shell that kills up to five zombies at once. Press enter to fire your bullet/shell. You may store upto three shells.

## Git History

Sadly the git history, if this ever had one, is lost to time.
